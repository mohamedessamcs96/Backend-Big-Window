In the code, the function passed to http.createServer() is a callback function because it is executed asynchronously when an event occurs—in this case, when an HTTP request is received.

Here’s why it’s a callback function:

1. Event-Driven Nature of Node.js:
Node.js is built around an event-driven architecture, meaning it waits for events (like incoming HTTP requests) and then reacts to them.
When you create an HTTP server with http.createServer(), you’re essentially registering a callback function to be executed whenever a specific event (an incoming request) happens.
2. Asynchronous Execution:
Node.js does not block the main thread while waiting for requests. Instead, it continues executing other code until a request comes in. Once a request is received, Node.js calls back the function you passed to http.createServer(), handling the request and response asynchronously.
3. Callback Purpose in this Case:
The callback function (req, res) => {...} is executed only when an HTTP request arrives. This function receives the req (request) and res (response) objects that allow you to process the request and send a response back to the client.
